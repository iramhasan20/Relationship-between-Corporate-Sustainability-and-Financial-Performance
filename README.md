# Relationship-between-Corporate-Sustainability-and-Financial-Performance

This repository contains code and analysis exploring the relationship between corporate social practices and financial outcomes using panel data regression (OLS, Fixed Effects, and Random Effects). It includes data processing, statistical models, and results analyzing the underlying impact of social responsibility on financial performance.

The code is structured under the following sections:

1. Descriptive Statistics
2. Model Diagnostic Checks
3. Panel Regression Analysis
4. Robustness Assessment â€“ Panel-Corrected Standard Errors

Following libraries are used in the code:

1. pandas: Handles data manipulation and analysis, including reading and processing datasets.
2. numpy: Provides numerical computing capabilities, including array operations and statistical functions.
3. statsmodels.api: Supports statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.
4. statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence: Computes diagnostic measures like Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for multicollinearity checks.
5. scipy.stats: Offers statistical tests such as t-tests, F-tests, and chi-square tests.
6. linearmodels.panel: Implements econometric models, including fixed and random effects models for panel data analysis.
